1] Connecting to DB 

  Next js is compartively a different framework, it is a edge time framework. As in, the backend does not run continiously it only runs when there is a request from user. 
  Runs only when there is a demand

  So if our backend is not running all the time, so the DB is also not connected all time 
  Jaise jaise request jati hai waise waise connection banta hai 

  IMP: whenever you make a next js application make sure the DB is already connected or not, 
  if not connected then only try to connect it 
  But if connected, no need to connect again
